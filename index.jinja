<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm Radu Ciorba, and I'm a software developer. This blog is a place for me to
collect and publish my thoughts.
</p>

<p> I've been using Python for over 10 years, on projects in various industries. I'm
currently employed at Bitdefender where I work with the Android anti-malware team. In the
past I've worked on <a href="https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/">PBS Learning Media</a> as
a software developer and technical lead, and have been part of the <a
href="https://www.presslabs.com">Presslabs</a> team as an operations engineed.</p>

<p>

I'm a believer in the value of open-source. You can see some of my own contributions on
the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page, or on <a
href="https://github.com/rciorba/">Github</a> and <a
href="https://bitbucket.com/raduciorba/">Bitbucket</a>.

</p>

<p>

If you want to contact me you can email me at radu [at] devrandom.ro or you can reach out
to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rcioba">twitter</a>.

<h2>About this site</h2>

This site is self hosted, and I've made an effort to include no thirt party tracking. You
can find the source on github. It's a simple ad-hock collection of jinja2 and markdown
content, rendered by a trivial script.

The background pattern is copied from <a href="https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark">Github Dark User Style (CC-A-SA)</a>.
